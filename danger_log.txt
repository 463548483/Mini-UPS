ECE568 final project: Mini-UPS

1. Database under multi-threading
There would be conficts when multiple threads are modifying the same table/ table entries
in the database. We solved the conflicts by using serialized database connection each thread.

2. UPS id doesn't exist
At amazon side, the user can enter an ups id when he/she places an order. So one can possibly
enter a non-existing ups id. We designed a UPSIdQuery command in the communication protocol between
UPS and Amazon so that we make sure this situation would never happen.

3. Retransmission strategy
When communicating with the simulation world, if flakiness is not 0, the world would drop
requests on purpose. So, we implement a time-out and retransmission logic to handle this kind
of responses missing.

4. Strong exception guarantee
If there's any exception happens during processing a request, we would catch it, output an error
message, and skip current request without killing the whole server.
